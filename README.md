# Value Bet Calculator

A powerful browser extension for sports bettors that helps identify profitable opportunities in football, basketball, and ice hockey markets. Calculate the true value of betting odds instantly and make smarter betting decisions.

## Overview

The Value Bet Calculator extension determines whether a bet offers "value" by comparing the true probability of an outcome with the implied probability from bookmaker odds. When the calculated value is positive, it indicates a potentially profitable betting opportunity where the odds are in your favor.

Using the formula **Value = (Probability Ã— Odds) â€“ 1**, this tool helps you identify bets where your estimated probability exceeds what the bookmaker is implying with their odds. This mathematical edge is the key to long-term profitability in sports betting.

## Features

  - Manual mode for entering your own probability estimates
  - Auto mode with real-time odds from the Pinnacle Odds API
